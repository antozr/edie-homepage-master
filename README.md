<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https:// /assets/img/Capture.PNG)

## The 3 steps for this design
For create this design, I have started with the mobile version for write the base of all items of this project and with the media(min-width:xxxpx) I change the specifical element somme the flex-direction:column in row. With the big screen, I change the font size and modify the size of images and box container. 

## For the menu / nav 
For create this, in mobile version I used the JS for actived or not with the addEventListener("click"). With this action, I change the opacity of the menu and with a animation I move the menu to open the box. 

## The box in column
For move the if the size of screen is smaller, the box change of row. For this I use the flex-wrap: wrap; . 

## The flex grid
For create the differently special box with the display: grid, it is easyer fot create the specifical design with the images and box persona.
